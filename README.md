## Classification of Pumpkin Seed Types Using Various Machine Learning Algorithms
In this analysis, a Jupyter Notebook was utilized to classify different types of pumpkin seeds using several machine learning algorithms. The dataset underwent preprocessing and was subjected to feature selection to ensure optimal performance.

## Algorithms and Methods Employed:
Random Forest:
An ensemble learning method based on constructing multiple decision trees.
Hyperparameters tuned for improved accuracy.

Kernel SVM (Support Vector Machine):
Used to handle non-linear data by applying kernel tricks.
Various kernels such as RBF and polynomial were experimented with.

Logistic Regression:
A straightforward and interpretable model used for binary and multi-class classification.
Regularization parameters were adjusted to prevent overfitting.

Ensemble Methods:
Combined predictions from multiple models to enhance performance.
Techniques such as bagging, boosting, and stacking were implemented.
Each model's performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. The results highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm in distinguishing between the pumpkin seed types, ultimately guiding towards the most effective classification strategy for this specific dataset.
